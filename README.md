# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN, Vision Transformer & Hybrid Models

## Overview
This project implements automated **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification** from retinal fundus images using deep learning.  
We designed, trained, and evaluated three architectures:

- CNN baseline (EfficientNet)
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
- Hybrid CNN–ViT model

The hybrid model combines **local lesion-level features** with **global contextual understanding**, achieving the best test performance.
